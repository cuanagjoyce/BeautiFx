<h3>Oily skin is the result of the overproduction of sebum from sebaceous glands. These glands are located under the skin’s surface.</h3>
<h3>Sebum is an oily substance made of fats. Sebum isn’t all bad since it helps protect and moisturize your skin and keep your hair shiny and healthy.</h3>
<h3>Too much sebum, however, may lead to oily skin, which can lead to clogged pores and acne. Genetics, hormone changes, or even stress may increase sebum production.</h3>
